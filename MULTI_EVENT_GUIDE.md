# Managing Multiple Events

The new **Events Manager** tab allows you to run multiple parties at once.

## Features

### 1. Events Manager Tab
- **View All**: See every event you've ever saved.
- **Actions**:
  - **✏️ Load**: Opens the event in the editor.
  - **📋 Copy**: Duplicates an event (great for recurring parties!).
  - **🗑️ Delete**: Removes old events.

### 2. Party Details Upgrades
- **✨ New Event**: Clears all fields so you can start fresh.
- **💾 Save Draft**: Saves your current work to the Events Manager *without* pushing to the live website. Perfect for drafting ideas.
- **🚀 Update & Push**: functionality remains the same (deploys to website AND saves to history).

## Recommended Workflow
1. Click **✨ New Event** to start a fresh party.
2. Fill in details.
3. Click **💾 Save Draft** often.
4. When ready to go live, click **🚀 Update & Push**.
5. To switch back to an old party, go to **Events Manager** and click **Load**.
