# Party Manager v2.0 - Enhancement Guide

## What's Being Added

1. Tooltips - Hover help on all buttons
2. Progress Bar - Visual feedback during Git operations  
3. Drag and Drop CSV - Drag files into the window
4. Recent Events - Quick access to past party settings

## Current Status

The Tooltip class has been added to the code! The foundation for all enhancements is now in place.

Given the complexity of properly implementing all 4 features with threading, drag-and-drop, and JSON persistence, I have two options for you:

### Option A: Step-by-Step Implementation
- I fully implement and test tooltips first
- You test it
- Then we add progress bar
- Continue one feature at a time

### Option B: Complete v2.0 Package  
- I create a complete party_manager_v2.pyw
- All 4 features fully working together
- Thoroughly tested
- Ready to use immediately

Which would you prefer?
