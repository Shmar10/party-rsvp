# Party Manager - What's New

## ✨ New Feature: Event Description Field

You can now edit the subtitle/description text that appears on your RSVP page!

### Where to Find It

In the **Party Details** tab, when you select "📝 Fill out form manually", you'll now see:

1. **Event Name** - The main title (e.g., "Shawn's Retirement!")
2. **Event Description** ⭐ **NEW!** - The subtitle text (e.g., "Join us for an unforgettable evening...")
3. **Date** - Event date
4. **Time** - Event time  
5. **Location** - Event location

### How It Works

The **Event Description** field is a text box where you can write 1-2 lines describing your event. This text appears just below the event name on your RSVP webpage.

**Examples:**
- "Join us for an unforgettable evening of music, drinks, and great company."
- "Let's celebrate this milestone together!"
- "Help us send off Shawn in style - bring your swimsuit and party spirit!"

### Pro Tip

Keep it concise and inviting. This is the first thing guests read after seeing the event name, so make it count!
